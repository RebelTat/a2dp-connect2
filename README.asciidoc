# a2dp-connect2

*This separate widget is going away.  Instead it is now integrated into link:https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume[A2DP Volume] starting with version 2.13.0.0.  Become a tester here https://play.google.com/apps/testing/a2dp.Vol and get that app now.*

This is a simple widget (not an app) to connect/disconnect from A2DP Bluetooth sinks.  That is all it does.

.To use it:
 . Install from Play Store
 . Pair your Bluetooth devices using Android settings
 . Turn Bluetooth ON
 . Place an instance of this widget on your home screen (launcher dependent on how you do this)
 . Click it to connect a device, again to disconnect.

The widget will connect if the device is currently not connected, and disconnect if the device is currently connected.

This app is a mess.  I have numerous timing and cross thread problems and need a real developer to help me architect this correctly. *I integrated this widget into link:https://github.com/jroal/a2dpvolume[A2DP Volume] instead of having it be a separate executable.*
